# Artifacts for FLOP: False Load Output Prediction Attacks on the Apple M3 CPU

This repository contains the artifacts for the paper "FLOP: False Load Output Prediction Attacks on the Apple M3 CPU", to appear at USENIX Security 2025. We share the following artifacts (copied from the open science section of the paper):

1. Source code, instructions, and compilation scripts for LVP reverse-engineering experiments (cf. Section 4)
1. Source code, binaries, instructions, and testing scripts for a browser-based read primitive on Safari (cf. Section 5)
1. Source code, binaries, instructions, and testing scripts for a browser-based read primitive on Chrome (cf. Section 6)

In addition, we bundle the prerequisites for running these experiments on macOS. We have tested this setup on macOS 14.5 build 23F79. The steps are as follows:

1. Install the Kernel Debug Kit (KDK) for macOS 14.5 build 23F79. You can download this at <https://developer.apple.com/download/more/>.
1. Follow the README in `pacmanpatcher` to create a patched version of the development kernel, which allows user code to count cycles. This is a slightly modified version of the PacmanPatcher artifact from the ISCA 2022 paper "PACMAN: attacking ARM pointer authentication with speculative execution".
1. Follow the README in `enable-dc-civac`, which is a kernel extension allowing cache flush instructions to run from user code.

The rest of the directories hold the artifacts. More specifically:

* `re` contains the reverse-engineering experiments for load value prediction.
* `re-kernel` contains the in-kernel expeiments for load value prediction.

* 아래는 용량이 커서 지웠음
* `webkit-poc` contains a JavaScript-based read primitive using the LVP for Safari.
* `safari` contains our patched version of Safari for running the read primitive in `webkit-poc`, as well as a patch file for reproducing the included binaries.
* `chrome-poc` contains a JavaScript and WebAssembly-based read primitive using the LVP for Chrome.
* `chrome` contains our patched version of Chrome for running the read primitive in `chrome-poc`, as well as a patch file for reproducing the included binaries.
